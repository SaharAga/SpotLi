# Changelog

All notable changes to Deliveree will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**Versioning convention (established 2026-08-22)**: standard `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` — MINOR bumps for new user-facing features/capabilities, PATCH bumps for bug fixes. `MAJOR` stays `0` while in alpha. (A non-standard 4th segment, e.g. `0.6.2.14`–`0.6.2.18`, crept in for a stretch of hotfix releases without being a deliberate decision — retired as of `0.7.0`. See `AGENT_SYNC.md`, 2026-08-22, for the discussion.)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-22

_Note: entries for 0.3.0-alpha through 0.6.2.17 were not recorded in this file — version bumps happened in `package.json`/`version.js` without a matching changelog entry. Not backfilled here; see git log for that history._

### Changed
- Removed Telegram integration from all app-facing code (feedback relay, package-status alerts, Settings UI) — kept ops/daemon scripts untouched.
- Consolidated the 3 separate add-package entry points into 1.
- Wired `syncQueueService.enqueue()` into the real package CRUD path in `App.jsx`/`AuthContext.jsx` — offline mutations (add/update/delete) now actually go through the sync queue and dead-letter handling instead of writing directly and silently dropping on failure.

### Planned
- Smart ingestion & AI parsing overhaul (automatic email-forwarding ingestion + AI-enhanced paste fallback) — see `docs/plans/2026-08-22-smart-ingestion-ai-parsing.md`.

## [0.2.0-alpha] - 2026-08-19

### Added
- **Firestore Security Rules Lockdown**: Granular zero-trust path rules restricting package access exclusively to verified `request.auth.uid` owners (`/users/{userId}/packages/{packageId}`).
- **Zod Runtime Validation**: Comprehensive schemas in `packageValidator.js` providing rigorous parsing, input sanitization, and defensive boundary protection.
- **Account & GDPR Data Deletion Modal**: Dedicated settings UI supporting complete user data wiping and GDPR export features.
- **PWA Auto-Update Lifecycle**: Service Worker update detection with user notification prompt and instant skip-waiting reload.
- **Cloud Firestore Feedback Collection**: Integrated user feedback mechanism capturing structured bug reports, ratings, and diagnostic payloads directly to Firestore `/feedback` with local cache fallback.
- **iOS Safe Area Inset Support**: Full viewport handling with `viewport-fit=cover` and dynamic notch/home bar bottom/top padding.
- **Unit Testing Suite**: High-coverage Vitest suites verifying schema validation, store synchronization, and versioning baselines.

### Changed
- Refactored `AccountModal` and `FeedbackModal` to dynamically bind to canonical `APP_VERSION`.
- Updated PWA Cache identifier to `deliveree-cache-v0.2.0-alpha`.
